  How do I edit my dotfiles with chezmoi?
  <a class="anchor" href="#how-do-i-edit-my-dotfiles-with-chezmoi">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There are four popular approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>chezmoi edit $FILE</code>. This will open the source file for <code>$FILE</code> in your
editor, including . For extra ease, use <code>chezmoi edit --apply $FILE</code> to apply
the changes when you quit your editor.</li>
<li>Use <code>chezmoi cd</code> and edit the files in the source directory directly. Run
<code>chezmoi diff</code> to see what changes would be made, and <code>chezmoi apply</code> to make
the changes.</li>
<li>If your editor supports opening directories, run <code>chezmoi edit</code> with no
arguments to open the source directory.</li>
<li>Edit the file in your home directory, and then either re-add it by running
<code>chezmoi add $FILE</code> or <code>chezmoi re-add</code>. Note that <code>re-add</code> doesn&rsquo;t work with
templates.</li>
<li>Edit the file in your home directory, and then merge your changes with source
state by running <code>chezmoi merge $FILE</code>.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-use-chezmoi-edit-to-edit-my-dotfiles">
  Do I have to use <code>chezmoi edit</code> to edit my dotfiles?
  <a class="anchor" href="#do-i-have-to-use-chezmoi-edit-to-edit-my-dotfiles">#</a>
</h2>
<p>No. <code>chezmoi edit</code> is a convenience command that has a couple of useful
features, but you don&rsquo;t have to use it.</p>
<p>You can also run <code>chezmoi cd</code> and then just edit the files in the source state
directly. After saving an edited file you can run <code>chezmoi diff</code> to check what
effect the changes would have, and run <code>chezmoi apply</code> if you&rsquo;re happy with
them. If there are inconsistencies that you want to keep, then <code>chezmoi merge-all</code> will help you resolve any differences.</p>
<p><code>chezmoi edit</code> provides the following useful features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The arguments to <code>chezmoi edit</code> are the files in their target location, so you
don&rsquo;t have to think about source state attributes and your editor&rsquo;s syntax
highlighting will work.</li>
<li>If the dotfile is encrypted in the source state, then <code>chezmoi edit</code> will
decrypt it to a private directory, open that file in your <code>$EDITOR</code>, and then
re-encrypt the file when you quit your editor. That makes encryption
transparent.</li>
<li>With the <code>--diff</code> and <code>--apply</code> options you can see what would change and
apply those changes without having to run <code>chezmoi diff</code> or <code>chezmoi apply</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you chose to edit files in the source state and you&rsquo;re using VIM then then
<a href="https://github.com/alker0/chezmoi.vim"><code>github.com/alker0/chezmoi.vim</code></a> gives
you syntax highlighting, however you edit your files.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-get-a-blank-buffer-when-running-chezmoi-edit">
  Why do I get a blank buffer when running <code>chezmoi edit</code>?
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-do-i-get-a-blank-buffer-when-running-chezmoi-edit">#</a>
</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening here is that your editor is forking, detaching, and terminating
the original process, which chezmoi cannot distinguish from the editor
terminating normally.</p>
<p>You have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Configure your editor command to remain in the foreground. For <code>vim</code>, this
means passing the <code>-f</code> flag, e.g. by setting the <code>edit.flags</code> configuration
variable to <code>[&quot;-f&quot;]</code>, or by setting the <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable to
include the <code>-f</code> flag, e.g. <code>export EDITOR=&quot;mvim -f&quot;</code>. For VSCode, pass the
<code>--wait</code> flag.</li>
<li>Set the <code>edit.hardlink</code> configuration variable to <code>false</code>.</li>
</ol>

</h2>
<p>Until you run <code>chezmoi apply</code> your modified <code>~/.zshrc</code> will remain in place.
When you run <code>chezmoi apply</code> chezmoi will detect that <code>~/.zshrc</code> has changed
since chezmoi last wrote it and prompt you what to do. You can resolve
differences with a merge tool by running <code>chezmoi merge ~/.zshrc</code>.</p>

  If there&rsquo;s a mechanism in place for the above, is there also a way to tell chezmoi to ignore specific files or groups of files (e.g. by directory name or by glob)?

</h2>
<p>By default, chezmoi ignores everything that you haven&rsquo;t explicitly added. If you
have files in your source directory that you don&rsquo;t want added to your
destination directory when you run <code>chezmoi apply</code> add their names to a file
called <code>.chezmoiignore</code> in the source state.</p>
<p>Patterns are supported, and you can change what&rsquo;s ignored from machine to
machine. The full usage and syntax is described in the <a href="/docs/reference/#chezmoiignore">reference

<p>Yes. Run <code>chezmoi add</code> will update the source state with the target. To see

</h2>
<p>You have several options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>chezmoi cd</code> opens a shell in the source directory, where you can run your
usual version control commands, like <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code>.</li>
<li><code>chezmoi git</code> runs <code>git</code> in the source
directory and pass extra arguments to the command. If you&rsquo;re passing any
flags, you&rsquo;ll need to use <code>--</code> to prevent chezmoi from consuming them, for
example <code>chezmoi git -- commit -m &quot;Update dotfiles&quot;</code>.</li>
<li>You can configure chezmoi to automatically commit and push changes to your
source state, as <a href="/docs/how-to/#automatically-commit-and-push-changes-to-your-repo">described in the how-to
guide</a>.</li>

  Why does chezmoi convert all my template variables to lowercase?
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-does-chezmoi-convert-all-my-template-variables-to-lowercase">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This is due to a feature in
<a href="https://github.com/spf13/viper"><code>github.com/spf13/viper</code></a>, the library that
chezmoi uses to read its configuration file. For more information see <a href="https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/463">this

  chezmoi makes <code>~/.ssh/config</code> group writeable. How do I stop this?
  <a class="anchor" href="#chezmoi-makes-sshconfig-group-writeable-how-do-i-stop-this">#</a>
</h2>
<p>By default, chezmoi uses your system&rsquo;s umask when creating files. On most
systems the default umask is <code>022</code> but some systems use <code>002</code>, which means
that files and directories are group writeable by default.</p>
<p>You can override this for chezmoi by setting the <code>umask</code> configuration variable
in your configuration file, for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml"><span style="color:#a6e22e">umask</span> = <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">o022</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note that this will apply to all files and directories that chezmoi manages and
will ensure that none of them are group writeable. It is not currently possible
to control group write permissions for individual files or directories. Please
<a href="https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=enhancement&amp;template=02_feature_request.md&amp;title=">open an issue on

  <a class="anchor" href="#why-does-chezmoi-cd-spawn-a-shell-instead-of-just-changing-directory">#</a>
</h2>
<p><code>chezmoi cd</code> spawns a shell because it is not possible for a program to change
the working directory of its parent process. You can add a shell function instead:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">chezmoi-cd<span style="color:#f92672">()</span> <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
    cd <span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>chezmoi source-path<span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span>
<span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Typing <code>chezmoi-cd</code> will then change the directory of your current shell to
chezmoi&rsquo;s source directory.</p>

<h2 id="why-doesnt-chezmoi-use-symlinks-like-gnu-stow">
  Why doesn&rsquo;t chezmoi use symlinks like GNU Stow?
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-doesnt-chezmoi-use-symlinks-like-gnu-stow">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Symlinks are first class citizens in chezmoi: chezmoi supports creating them,
updating them, removing them, and even more advanced features not found
elsewhere like having the same symlink point to different targets on different
machines by using a template.</p>
<p>With chezmoi, you only use a symlink where you really need a symlink, in
contrast to some other dotfile managers (e.g. GNU Stow) which require the use of
symlinks as a layer of indirection between a dotfile&rsquo;s location (which can be
anywhere in your home directory) and a dotfile&rsquo;s content (which needs to be in a
centralized directory that you manage with version control). chezmoi solves this
problem in a different way.</p>
<p>Instead of using a symlink to redirect from the dotfile&rsquo;s location to the
centralized directory, chezmoi generates the dotfile as a regular file in its
final location from the contents of the centralized directory. This approach
allows chezmoi to provide features that are not possible when using symlinks,
for example having files that are encrypted, executable, private, or templates.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing special about dotfiles managed by chezmoi, whereas dotfiles
managed with GNU Stow are special because they&rsquo;re actually symlinks to somewhere
else.</p>
<p>The only advantage to using GNU Stow-style symlinks is that changes that you
make to the dotfile&rsquo;s contents in the centralized directory are immediately
visible, whereas chezmoi currently requires you to run <code>chezmoi apply</code> or
<code>chezmoi edit --apply</code>. chezmoi will likely get an alternative solution to this
too, see <a href="https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/752">#752</a>.</p>
<p>If you really want to use symlinks, then chezmoi provides a <a href="/docs/reference/#symlink-mode">symlink
mode</a>
which uses symlinks where possible.</p>
<p>You can configure chezmoi to work like GNU Stow and have it create a set of
symlinks back to a central directory, but this currently requires a bit of
manual work (as described in
<a href="https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/167">#167</a>). chezmoi might get some
automation to help (see <a href="https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/886">#886</a>
for example) but it does need some convincing use cases that demonstrate that a
symlink from a dotfile&rsquo;s location to its contents in a central directory is
better than just having the correct dotfile contents.</p>

  What are the limitations of chezmoi&rsquo;s symlink mode?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-are-the-limitations-of-chezmois-symlink-mode">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In symlink mode chezmoi replaces targets with symlinks to the source directory
if the the target is a regular file and is not encrypted, executable, private,
or a template.</p>
<p>Symlinks cannot be used for encrypted files because the source state contains
the ciphertext, not the plaintext.</p>
<p>Symlinks cannot be used for executable files as the executable bit would need to
be set on the file in the source directory and chezmoi uses only regular files
and directories in its source state for portability across operating systems.
This may change in the future.</p>
<p>Symlinks cannot be used for private files because git does not persist group and
world permission bits.</p>
<p>Symlinks cannot be used for templated files because the source state contains
the template, not the result of executing the template.</p>
<p>Symlinks cannot be used for entire directories because of chezmoi&rsquo;s use of
attributes in the filename mangles entries in the directory, directories might
have the <code>exact_</code> attribute and contain empty files, and the directory&rsquo;s entries
might not be usable with symlinks.</p>
<p>In symlink mode, running <code>chezmoi add</code> does not immediately replace the targets
with a symlink. You must run <code>chezmoi apply</code> to create the symlinks.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-change-how-chezmois-source-state-is-represented-on-disk">
  Can I change how chezmoi&rsquo;s source state is represented on disk?
  <a class="anchor" href="#can-i-change-how-chezmois-source-state-is-represented-on-disk">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There are a number of criticisms of how chezmoi&rsquo;s source state is represented on
disk:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not all possible file permissions can be represented.</li>
<li>The long source file names are weird and verbose.</li>
<li>Everything is in a single directory, which can end up containing many entries.</li>
</ol>
<p>chezmoi&rsquo;s source state representation is a deliberate, practical compromise.</p>
<p>The <code>dot_</code> attribute makes it transparent which dotfiles are managed by chezmoi
and which files are ignored by chezmoi. chezmoi ignores all files and
directories that start with <code>.</code> so no special whitelists are needed for version
control systems and their control files (e.g. <code>.git</code> and <code>.gitignore</code>).</p>
<p>chezmoi needs per-file metadata to know how to interpret the source file&rsquo;s
contents, for example to know when the source file is a template or if the
file&rsquo;s contents are encrypted. By storing this metadata in the filename, the
metadata is unambiguously associated with a single file and adding, updating, or
removing a single file touches only a single file in the source state. Changes
to the metadata (e.g. <code>chezmoi chattr +template *target*</code>) are simple file
renames and isolated to the affected file.</p>
<p>If chezmoi were to, say, use a common configuration file listing which files
were templates and/or encrypted, then changes to any file would require updates
to the common configuration file. Automating updates to configuration files
requires a round trip (read config file, update config, write config) and it is
not always possible preserve comments and formatting.</p>
<p>chezmoi&rsquo;s attributes of <code>executable_</code>, <code>private_</code>, and <code>readonly_</code> allow a the
file permissions <code>0o644</code>, <code>0o755</code>, <code>0o600</code>, <code>0o700</code>, <code>0o444</code>, <code>0o555</code>, <code>0o400</code>,
and <code>0o500</code> to be represented. Directories can only have permissions <code>0o755</code>,
<code>0o700</code>, or <code>0o500</code>. In practice, these cover all permissions typically used for
dotfiles. If this does cause a genuine problem for you, please <a href="https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/new/choose">open an issue on
GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>File permissions and modes like <code>executable_</code>, <code>private_</code>, <code>readonly_</code>, and
<code>symlink_</code> could also be stored in the filesystem, rather than in the filename.
However, this requires the permissions to be preserved and handled by the
underlying version control system and filesystem. chezmoi provides first-class
support for Windows, where the <code>executable_</code> and <code>private_</code> attributes have no
direct equivalents and symbolic links are not always permitted. By using regular
files and directories, chezmoi avoids variations in the operating system,
version control system, and filesystem making it both more robust and more
portable.</p>
<p>chezmoi uses a 1:1 mapping between entries in the source state and entries in
the target state. This mapping is bi-directional and unambiguous.</p>
<p>However, this also means that dotfiles that in the same directory in the target
state must be in the same directory in the source state. In particular, every
entry managed by chezmoi in the root of your home directory has a corresponding
entry in the root of your source directory, which can mean that you end up with
a lot of entries in the root of your source directory.</p>
<p>If chezmoi were to permit, say, multiple separate source directories (so you
could, say, put <code>dot_bashrc</code> in a <code>bash/</code> subdirectory, and <code>dot_vimrc</code> in a
<code>vim/</code> subdirectory, but have <code>chezmoi apply</code> map these to <code>~/.bashrc</code> and
<code>~/.vimrc</code> in the root of your home directory) then the mapping between source
and target states is no longer bidirectional nor unambiguous, which
significantly increases complexity and requires more user interaction. For
example, if both <code>bash/dot_bashrc</code> and <code>vim/dot_bashrc</code> exist, what should be
the contents of <code>~/.bashrc</code>? If you run <code>chezmoi add ~/.zshrc</code>, should
<code>dot_zshrc</code> be stored in the source <code>bash/</code> directory, the source <code>vim/</code>
directory, or somewhere else? How does the user communicate their preferences?</p>
<p>chezmoi has many users and any changes to the source state representation must
be backwards-compatible.</p>
<p>In summary, chezmoi&rsquo;s source state representation is a compromise with both
advantages and disadvantages. Changes to the representation will be considered,
but must meet the following criteria, in order of importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be fully backwards-compatible for existing users.</li>
<li>Fix a genuine problem encountered in practice.</li>
<li>Be independent of the underlying operating system, version control system,
and filesystem.</li>
<li>Not add significant extra complexity to the user interface or underlying
implementation.</li>
</ol>

  <a class="anchor" href="#the-output-of-chezmoi-diff-is-broken-and-does-not-contain-color-what-could-be-wrong">#</a>
</h3>
<p>By default, chezmoi&rsquo;s diff output includes ANSI color escape sequences (e.g.
<code>ESC[37m</code>) and is piped into your pager (by default <code>less</code>). chezmoi assumes
that your pager passes through the ANSI color escape sequences, as configured on
many systems, but not all. If your pager does not pass through ANSI color escape
sequences then you will see monochrome diff output with uninterpreted ANSI color
escape sequences.</p>
<p>This can typically by fixed by setting the environment variable</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ export LESS<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>-R
</code></pre></div><p>which instructs <code>less</code> to display &ldquo;raw&rdquo; control characters via the <code>-R</code> /
<code>--RAW-CONTROL-CHARS</code> option.</p>
<p>You can also set the <code>pager</code> configuration variable in your config file, for
example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml"><span style="color:#a6e22e">pager</span> = <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;less -R&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If you have set a different pager (via the <code>pager</code> configuration variable or
<code>PAGER</code> environment variable) then you must ensure that it passes through raw
control characters. Alternatively, you can use the <code>--color=false</code> option to
chezmoi to disable colors or the <code>--no-pager</code> option to chezmoi to disable the
pager.</p>

<p>Passphrases are not supported because chezmoi needs to decrypt files regularly,
e.g. when running a <code>chezmoi diff</code> or a <code>chezmoi status</code> command, not just when

<p>chezmoi will report this when it is unable to lock its persistent state

<p>This can happen, for example, if you have a <code>run_</code> script that invokes

<p>Under the hood, chezmoi uses <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt">bbolt</a> which

  What inspired chezmoi?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-inspired-chezmoi">#</a>
</h2>
<p>chezmoi was inspired by <a href="https://puppet.com/">Puppet</a>, but was created because
Puppet is an overkill for managing your personal configuration files. The focus
of chezmoi will always be personal home directory management. If your needs grow
beyond that, switch to a whole system configuration management tool.</p>

  <a class="anchor" href="#why-not-use-ansiblechefpuppetsalt-or-similar-to-manage-my-dotfiles-instead">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Whole system management tools are more than capable of managing your dotfiles,
but are large systems that entail several disadvantages. Compared to whole
system management tools, chezmoi offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small, focused feature set designed for dotfiles. There&rsquo;s simply less to learn
with chezmoi compared to whole system management tools.</li>
<li>Easy installation and execution on every platform, without root access.
Installing chezmoi requires only copying a single binary file with no external
dependencies. Executing chezmoi just involves running the binary. In contrast,
installing and running a whole system management tool typically requires
installing a scripting language runtime, several packages, and running a
system service, all typically requiring root access.</li>
</ul>
<p>chezmoi&rsquo;s focus and simple installation means that it runs almost everywhere:
from tiny ARM-based Linux systems to Windows desktops, from inside lightweight
containers to FreeBSD-based virtual machines in the cloud.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-use-chezmoi-to-manage-files-outside-my-home-directory">
  Can I use chezmoi to manage files outside my home directory?
  <a class="anchor" href="#can-i-use-chezmoi-to-manage-files-outside-my-home-directory">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In practice, yes, you can, but this is strongly discouraged beyond using your
system&rsquo;s package manager to install the packages you need.</p>
<p>chezmoi is designed to operate on your home directory, and is explicitly not a
full system configuration management tool. That said, there are some ways to
have chezmoi manage a few files outside your home directory.</p>
<p>chezmoi&rsquo;s scripts can execute arbitrary commands, so you can use a <code>run_</code> script
that is run every time you run <code>chezmoi apply</code>, to, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the target file outside your home directory a symlink to a file managed
by chezmoi in your home directory.</li>
<li>Copy a file managed by chezmoi inside your home directory to the target file.</li>
<li>Execute a template with <code>chezmoi execute-template --output=filename template</code>
where <code>filename</code> is outside the target directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>chezmoi executes all scripts as the user executing chezmoi, so you may need to
add extra privilege elevation commands like <code>sudo</code> or <code>PowerShell start -verb runas -wait</code> to your script.</p>
<p>chezmoi, by default, operates on your home directory but this can be overridden
with the <code>--destination</code> command line flag or by specifying <code>destDir</code> in your
config file, and could even be the root directory (<code>/</code> or <code>C:\</code>). This allows
you, in theory, to use chezmoi to manage any file in your filesystem, but this
usage is extremely strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>If your needs extend beyond modifying a handful of files outside your target
system, then existing configuration management tools like
<a href="https://puppet.com/">Puppet</a>, <a href="https://chef.io/">Chef</a>,
<a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>, and <a href="https://www.saltstack.com/">Salt</a> are
much better suited - and of course can be called from a chezmoi <code>run_</code> script.
Put your Puppet Manifests, Chef Recipes, Ansible Modules, and Salt Modules in a
directory ignored by <code>.chezmoiignore</code> so they do not pollute your home
directory.</p>
